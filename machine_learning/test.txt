householder and all other people 15 years and 
older in the household, whether or not they are 
related to the householder.
Median: The point that divides the household 
income distribution into halves, one half with 
income above the median and the other with 
income below the median. The median is based 
on the income distribution of all households, 
including those with no income.
Gini index: A summary measure of income 
inequality. The Gini index varies from 0 to 1, with 
0 indicating perfect equality, where there is a 
proportional distribution of income. A Gini index 
of 1 indicates perfect inequality, where one
