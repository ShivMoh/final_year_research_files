- [ ] Do a timeline
- [ ] what are the tools do you use: use existing api -> prototype for now. Existing GUI
- [ ] read more on dpo: why this algo? why this over others?

focus on building in the timeline
in december do the experiment planning
proposal by december

m = 50
min -> 10 
half of this -> 25
out of the 50, say 25 signup. evaluation by end of january

end of februaury -> do second set of evuation

Plan for the entire year -> proposal and just
January -> first artefact
June -> stick to 

do the artefact

starting in two weeks -> plan the artefact

two different session for two different
data will be anonymous

## Test
test this algorithm
get user feedback
testing the algorithm on consumer hardware
showing effects on small datasets, scare data

## Past Student
chat bot offers answers based on that.

justify the algorithm: especially for ITS

additional hypothesis artefact

Could this thing work with integrated GPU
