#### Why would I pick this algorithm?

- Simplicity
- Efficiency
- Competes with other state of the art algorithms such as ppo, while requiring considerable less steps

Things to look up:
- what is the win rate evalatuion
- actor critic and monte carlo RL

Uses a cross enthropy loss. This is key to how it ensures preferences, as rejected preferences will result in a weighted loss
##### Preference Framework Models
