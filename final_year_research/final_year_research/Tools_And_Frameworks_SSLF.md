The perception dimension describes learners as sensory or intuitive depending on the way in which they prefer perceive the world, externally through observing and gathering data through the senses (sensory) or internally through speculation or hunches (intuitive).

The input dimension classes learners as visual or verbal according to their preferred method of receiving external
information, e.g. seeing diagrams (visual) or reading textual explanations (verbal).

The processing dimension labels learners as active or reflective corresponding to the way they convert information into knowledge, e.g. by discussing information (active) or through introspective thought (reflective).

The understanding dimension describes learners as sequential or global depending on their progression towards understanding, e.g. whether they take continual steps (sequential) or first gain an overview of a topic before exploring the detail (global)
