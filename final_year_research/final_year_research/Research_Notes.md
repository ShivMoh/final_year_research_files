## Kinda Dated
1. Aim to respond to open ended questions from any particular field of study
2. Aim to design a suitable user interface for maximising interact -> TTS / SST 
3. Adaptable in two contexts:
	1. helps reduce development costs by allowing the system to easily augment itself with new knowledge
	2. adapts to the student effectively

## Supervised Learning Frame + ITS

#### Steps Forward
- Find potential self supervised frameworks to be used 
- Find suitable foundation language models for use in the self supervised learning framework
- Find and identify components of typical question-response ITS (if that is there)
- Find typical architectural designs of ITS

#### Draft Research Question

What is the framework of a Intelligent Tutoring System that utilises a self-supervised learning framework to generate personalised responses for Computer Science students? -> how do others interpret this?

What is the framework of a self-supervised learning framework that aims to integrate itself into into the adaption layer of a four-model intelligent tutoring system? -> for low resource devices, low compute (PI, ) 

1. proposal
2. literature review -> artefact will be whatever i build
3. other things
4. methodology
5. implementation
6. evaluation
7. results -> presenting, defending
8. 3 years

existing ITS -> voice based, text based 
datasets -> UG lecture notes
how to build an ITS?
self supervised learning?

UML diagrams but not UML...

do a slide of information on these things and stuff 
- 3-4 ITS and if it can be used or not
- 1-2 self supervised learning stuff 
#### Draft Objectives
1. To design a interface that facilitates the collection of interaction history between user and system 
2. To integrate the self supervised learning framework profiling to analyse and update its memory about the particular student
3. To determine the specific configurations and parameters suitable for on device personalisation for the self-supervised framework
4. To determine the specific modules that will compose the system (e.g. a typical four structure module has UI, Teacher, Student, Domain)

what are existing ITS?
what are existing self supervied system?

are there any research combining the two? -> 

**This is what i want to do:** A framework for adaption for on-device personalisation with a focus for text generation in an Conversational Tutoring System

I wanna see if I can build a system that can incoorporate a student's interaction history and use that data to update its model parameters inorder to foster engagement by providing personalised responses

## Things I want to Change

- change ssl to preference learning
- evaluate ppo algorithm
