## Personalizing Robot Tutors to Individual's Learning Differences (2014)

This researched the role and effect of personalization for robot tutors on student learning. It concluded that personalized tutors resulted in a one sigma improvement over non personalized learning. 

Most participants were graduate and undergraduate students of Yale University with little to no knowledge of robotics and artificial intelligence.

Terms Introduced:
- Bloom's two sigma
- bayesian network
- nonograms (just a type of puzzle, not really relevant)

Robots:
- Hugging robot
- Snackbot
- Keepon

## Affective Personalization of a Social Robot Tutor for Children's  Second Language Skills (2016)

The research involved the creation of a robot enabled with vision and language inputs paired with a game designed for learning spanish. There was the robot and the 'tucan'. The robot served as a encouraging tutor while the tucan served as an informative third party speaker. 

The experiment effectively utilized a reinforcement learning algorithm (I believe Q Learning) that learned the children's behaviours and updated itself accordingly. The research found that the children's learning improved as the learning became more personalized.

Critique: could it be that the learning simply improved because the children had more overall time with the platform and learning spanish as a whole. Over time, concepts could be more likely to be caught by kids.

Terms Introduced.

- Intelligent Tutoring Systems
- Valence 
- Affect Aware Tutors

## Personalized Robot Tutoring Using the Assistive Tutor POMDP (AT-POMDP) (2019)

Another dseign focused on robot tutoring. In this case it used long division as the task in question for 4th grade students

Robots:
Nao robot

Terms:
AT-POMDP
Bayesian Knowledge Tracing
Markov Decision Process

## Personalization and Customisation of LLM Responses (2023)

The paper basically explores and states the need for personalized LLM Responses. It also introduced its own system created for recommendation systems, PALR (Personalized Aware LLM for Recommendation) 

## Personalized Response with Generative AI Improving Interaction with Zero-Shot Learning LLM Chatbot


A thesis on said topic that dwelves into using personalize LLMs for customer service. It designs its system for doing that and evaluates it with users. It utilizes various metrics such as readability, complexity and sentiment.


## A Model-Free Affective Reinforcement Learning Approach to Personalization of an Autonomous Social Robot Companion for Early Literacy Education

Designed a Q Learning approach for teachning and improving children's language skills. To note, this robot interacted with student's through the use of story telling and was paired with a tablet device that would display illustrations. The study also evaluated the effects of the personalized robot companion on the children's learning and engagement over a 3 month period. They noticed the following:

- Children learned more words from a personalized robot peer - The story teller policy effectively personalized to each child
- Children's verbal and non verbal engagement cues are significantly correlated
- Children's nonverbal & physiclogical cues show higher attention and engagement in Personalized condition

Robot:
Tega bot


## Personalized LLM Response Generation with Parameterized Memory Injection (2024)

Introduces and evaluates a new method for generating personalized LLM reponses called MiLP (Memory-injected LLM Personalization). The method utlized LoRas, Bayesian Optimal Search, etc and I'm gonna pretend like i know what that means.


##  One Chatbot Per Person: Creating Personalized Chatbots based on Implicit User Profiles (2021)

Basically introduces its own method **Dialogue History Automatically for Personalized chatbots (DHAP)** that learns from the previous user-response interaction pairs and then uses that to create a user profile implicitly.

Focuses on the Response Generation Problem for Generation based methods rather than Retrieval based methods.

## The Design and Implementation of XiaoIce, an Empathetic Social Chatbot

Essentially describtes the systems that are used to create Xiaocice (little ice in literal chinine)

There are many features, but of note, techniques mentioned are Seg2Seg, Markov Decision Processes, DSSM (Deep Structural Semanitic Models)

Also brought up satori: Microsoft's Knowledge graph




## A Personalization Effect in Multimedia Learning: Students Learn Better When Words Are in Conversational Style Rather Than Formal Style (2004)

So basically explored and confirmed the personalization principle: "In multimedial instructional messages, present the words in conversational style rather than in formal style"

This in effect means that simple address the user directly using words such as "you", "your", etc rather than "the", etc.




In the field of cognitive science, it was determined that through the use of the personalization principle, students learned and retained knowledge more readily and frequently through the use of informal (personal) dialogue rather than formal dialogue.
